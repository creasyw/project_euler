#Problem 21:
#Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers  
#less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a,  
#where a != b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b  
#are called amicable numbers. 
# 
#For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20,  
#22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of  
#284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220. 
# 
#Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
